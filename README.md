# Dependencies
[OpenCV for Python](https://opencv.org)

# Clone this Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunglope/bad-apple.git
```
# Guide
Make sure you installed OpenCV for Python, you can install via `pip` command

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
Make sure you are using lastest ```pip``` version. You can check with ```pip -V``` command, mine is 23.1.2
```bash
pip 23.1.2
```

Use ```get frame.py``` to get every single frame from the original video, highly recommended using a SSD for better generating speed. After a while, it should generated about over 6000-7000 frames.
When you done with get frame, move to ```main.py``` and start

# Enjoy!
